I'm a 3rd year Ph.D. student at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). I received an academic master degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). My work lies in the intersection between **Robotics** and **AI**, with a focus on **human-level domestic service manipulation skill for humanoid robots**. I was previously an intern at Huawei 2012 Lab.
